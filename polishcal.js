Example of shunting yard algorithm. invented by Edsger Dijkstra 
***************************************************************

 >namesake is bc the algorithm operation resembles a railroad shunting yard

 >shunting yard is a railway yard found at some freight train stations, used to separate 
  railroad cards onto one of several tracks


 >many examples of this convert from infix to post fix. sub unshift() for push(), and you
  probably have an answer, maybe. 

 >resource for operator precendence REMEMBER THE ORDER OF OPERATORS WILL LIKELY
  NEED TO BE REVERSED
